# Fisheries time series analysis
This repository provides Python scripts developed to reproduce the analyses performed on the dataset used in the article “Nonlinear analysis of time series of Brazilian fishery data: entropy, complexity, and persistence.”

The scripts enable the calculation of entropy, complexity, and ordinal persistence metrics, as well as the generation of all figures presented in the article (Figures 1–7) and its appendices (Figures 8, 10, and 11), ensuring complete reproducibility of the analyses.
